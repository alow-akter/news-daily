                        <p> A variable declaration is simply
                            telling the computer that a variable exists and what value it should start with. Similar to
                            other programming languages JavaScript also allows for the declaration of variables.

                            There are three keywords in JavaScript that can be used to declare variables: let, var, and
                            const. Each keyword has different rules and implications for how the variables they create
                            can
                            be used.

                        <strong>
                            The let keyword declares a block-scoped local variable, optionally initializing it to a
                            value.
                            Block-scoped means that the variable is only available within the block it was declared in,
                            which is usually denoted by curly braces {}.

                            The var keyword declares a function-scoped or global variable, optionally initializing it to
                            a value.
                            Function-scoped means that the variable is only available within the function it was
                            declared in. Global variables are available throughout your entire code.

                        <strong>
                            The const keyword declares a block-scoped, immutable constant variable, i.e. a variable that
                            can’t be reassigned.
                            Constants are also called “immutable variables”, but that’s a bit of a misnomer since they
                            are actually variables – just ones that can’t be reassigned.

                            In regular function, arguments will give you list of parameter passed in function, In arrow
                            function arguments is not defined. In regular function, you always have to return any value,
                            but in Arrow function you can skip return keyword and write in single line.

                            The behavior of this inside of an arrow function differs considerably from the regular
                            function's this behavior. The arrow function doesn't define its own execution context.

                            No matter how or where being executed, this value inside of an arrow function always equals
                            this value from the outer function. In other words, the arrow function resolves this
                            lexically.

                            In the following example, myMethod() is an outer function of callback() arrow function:

                        <strong>
                            Inside of a regular JavaScript function, this value (aka the execution context) is dynamic.

                            The dynamic context means that the value of this depends on how the function is invoked. In
                            JavaScript, there are 4 ways you can invoke a regular function.

                            The main difference between forEach and filter is that forEach just loop over the array and
                            executes the callback but filter executes the callback and check its return value. If the
                            value is true element remains in the resulting array but if the return value is false the
                            element will be removed for the resulting array.

                            Example:
                            In the example below we would use .forEach() to iterate over an array of food and log that
